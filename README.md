* [basic_math_operations.html](basic_math_operations.html) - education of multiplication, division, addition and substraction. It is possible to define which mathematical
  operations will be generated. 
  
  If chosen multiplication it is possible to define value for *first factor* - **násobky** and *second factor* - **násobenie s**

  If chosen division it is possible to define value for *dividend* - **delitele** and *quotient (division result)* - **podiel - výsledok delenia**
* [tone_generator.html](tone_generator.html) - generates some basic tones after press key on keyboard (press of 'c' key => generate c4 tone).
* [canvas_square_circling.html](canvas_square_circling.html) - square is going in circle which has still the same diameter and speed is constant. Nothing depends on frame frequency
* [canvas_buble_sorting.html](canvas_buble_sorting.html) - sorting demo (quick sort). Demonstrate (step-by-step) how quick sort alrogithm works. It is possible to view it in automatic mode (no interaction) or manual mode where it is possible to klik on button to get to next step of algorithm. In automatic mode it is possible to specify frequency of rendering next sorting step.

### graphs

    * string interpolation,
    * timing of execution of some action (**setInterval()**, **clearInterval()**) - updating date (like watch)
* [jq_study_events.html](jq_study_events.html) demonstrate (via JQ) usage of HTML events:
    * hide
    * hover
    * mouseenter
    * mouseleave
    * click
* [jq_study_fade.html](jq_study_fade.html) demonstrate (via JQ) usage of fading (miznutie) of HTML elements.

* [js_study_output.html](js_study_output.html) - demonstrate possibility to directly write on webpage (overwrite previous content)


# JAVA SCRIPT
## XPATH
```javascript
//for www.shmu.sk
//select all links with rel = 'dns-prefetch'
//it is also possible to use $x('//link[@rel="dns-prefetch"]/@href')
var links = document.evaluate('//link[@rel="dns-prefetch"]/@href', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null);
console.log(links);
for(var i = 1; i<=links.snapshotLength; i++) {
	console.log(links.snapshotItem(i));
}
